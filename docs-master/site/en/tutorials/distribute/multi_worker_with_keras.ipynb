In multi-worker training, there is usually one `worker` that takes on a little more responsibility like saving checkpoint and writing summary file for TensorBoard in addition to what a regular `worker` does. Such worker is referred to as the 'chief' worker, and it is customary that the `worker` with `index` 0 is appointed as the chief `worker` (in fact this is how `tf.distribute.Strategy` is implemented). `task` on the other hand provides information of the current task.  \n",
