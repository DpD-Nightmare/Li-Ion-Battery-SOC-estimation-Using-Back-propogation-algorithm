# Keras

`tf.keras` is TensorFlow's high-level API for building and training deep
learning models. It's used for fast prototyping, state-of-the-art research,
and production, with three key advantages:

-   *User-friendly*<br> Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for
    common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.
-   *Modular and composable*<br> Keras models are made by connecting
    configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.
-   *Easy to extend*<br> Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for
    research. Create new layers, metrics, loss functions, and develop
    state-of-the-art models.

The guide [Keras: A Quick Overview](./overview.ipynb) will help you get started.
