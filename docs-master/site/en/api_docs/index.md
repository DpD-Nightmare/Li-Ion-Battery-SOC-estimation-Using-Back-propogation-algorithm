# API Documentation

TensorFlow has APIs available in several languages both for constructing and
executing a TensorFlow graph.  The Python API is at present the most complete
and the easiest to use, but other language APIs may be easier to integrate
into projects and may offer some performance advantages in graph execution.

A word of caution: the APIs in languages other than Python are not yet
covered by the [API stability promises](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/versions).

* [Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/)
* [JavaScript](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/)
* [C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/)
* [Java](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/java/reference/org/tensorflow/package-summary)
* [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)
* [Swift (Early Release)](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift)


We encourage the community to develop and maintain support for other languages
with the [approach recommended by the TensorFlow maintainers](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/guide/extend/bindings.md).
For example, see the bindings for:

* C#: [TensorFlowSharp](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp) and [TensorFlow.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET),
* [Haskell](https://github.com/tensorflow/haskell),
* [Julia](https://github.com/malmaud/TensorFlow.jl),
* [MATLAB](https://github.com/asteinh/tensorflow.m),
* [Ruby](https://github.com/somaticio/tensorflow.rb),
* [Rust](https://github.com/tensorflow/rust), and
* [Scala](https://github.com/eaplatanios/tensorflow_scala).

We also provide the C++ API reference for TensorFlow Serving:

* [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving)
