    "There are two key problems shaping all thinking about objects in images: image classiﬁcation and object detection. They are much more complicated than the problems like boundary detection. Thus more complicated models are needed to deal with the problems even challenging to human's eyes. For the image classification problem, we use a convolutional neural network to extract patterns of an image. For the case of object detection, we use Recursive CNN, which can assist to find the locations of objects of a set of classes in the image. These two models will be detailly introduced in the following sections."

Traditional ways convert grayscale or RGB images into a list of numbers representing the intensity of that pixel and then do classification job on top of this procedure. Currently One of the most popular techniques used in improving the accuracy of traditional image classification ways is Convolutional Neural Networks which is more similar to the principle of human seeing things.\n",

    "CNN is different from other neural networks in that it has a convolution layer at the beginning. Instead of converting the image to an array of numbers, the image is broken up into some sections by the convolutional kernel, the machine then tries to predict what each section is. Finally, the computer tries to predict what’s in the picture based on the votes of all sections. \n",
